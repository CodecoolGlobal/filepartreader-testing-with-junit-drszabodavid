Edom Refuses Passage
14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom:
Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship
that we have met: 15 how our fathers went down to Egypt,
and we lived in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians dealt
harshly with us and our fathers. 16 And when we cried to
the LORD, he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought
us out of Egypt. And here we are in Kadesh, a city on
the edge of your territory. 17 Please let us pass through
your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, or
apa
drink water from a well. We will go along the King's Highway.
We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until
we have passed through your territory." 18 But Edom said to him,
"You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword
against you." 19 And the people of Israel said to him, "We
ahha
will go up by the highway, and if we drink of your water,
I and my livestock, then I will pay for it. Let me only
pass through on foot, nothing more." 20 But he said,
"You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against
them with a large army and with a strong force. 21 Thus
Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory,
so Israel turned away from him.
